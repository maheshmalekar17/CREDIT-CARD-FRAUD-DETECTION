# CREDIT-CARD-FRAUD-DETECTION
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions in a credit card dataset using Logistic Regression. The dataset, creditcard.csv, is preprocessed by dropping the 'Time' column and standardizing the features with StandardScaler. Initial model training and evaluation on the original dataset are performed, showcasing performance through classification reports and confusion matrices. To address the issue of class imbalance, the dataset is resampled using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), generating synthetic samples for the minority class. After resampling, the Logistic Regression model is retrained, achieving an impressive 99% accuracy. This improved model performance underscores the importance of handling imbalanced data in fraud detection. The final evaluation includes a detailed classification report and a confusion matrix, visualized using a heatmap to clearly illustrate the results.
